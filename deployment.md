# Deployment

This Userbot can be deployed with four different ways, which are Termux, Heroku, Docker and Legacy way.

[**Termux**](https://theuserge.github.io/termux) - Run the Userbot in Termux (mobile).

[**Heroku**](https://theuserge.github.io/deployment.html#deploy-to-heroku) - Run the Userbot in a cloud application. It's the easy way to use Userge!

[**Docker**](https://theuserge.github.io/deployment.html#deploying-with-docker-) - Run the Userbot in an isolated application that doesn't interfere to the system but uses your same system hardware and internet. You Just have to fill mandatory vars and 2-3 line commands to Run Userge on Docker.

[**Legacy-Method**](https://theuserge.github.io/deployment.html#deploying-with-legacy-method) - Using Python and all those packages which are required to Run this bot. You can also say a Manual way to deploy a userbot.

## Deploy to Heroku

Fork the Helper Script [Repo](https://github.com/rking32/HelperScript) then Rename your fork with some random names and deploy . Deploy Link will be in Format given below.
```
https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/username/repo_name
```

## Deploying with Docker üê≥

**1. Install Docker**

Follow the official Docker [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

You need to clone Userge repository first by running:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/UsergeTeam/Loader.git
```
Go to the working directory by running:
```
cd Loader
```

Open & set all the necessary vars in `config.env` file. For example, the `config.env` is in `config.env.sample`:
```bash
mv config.env.sample config.env
```
Then edit `config.env` with your favorite text editor and save it!

Build Docker image by running:

```
docker build . -t userge
```

Run container by:

```
docker run -d --restart on-failure --name userge_1 userge
```
Explanation of the command flags above :

1. `-d`: (_detach_) This will make your Docker running even if you exit your console.

2. `--restart on-failure`: Docker container will automatically restart if there is a failure on the running system.

3. `--name userge_1`: Custom name for your container, instead of using the container ID, this makes it easier for you to find it.

To stop Docker container, run:

```bash
docker container stop userge_1
```
To get container logs:

```bash
docker logs userge_1 
```
## Run userge with Docker-Compose üêã
**1. Install Docker-Compose**

The easiest way to install docker-compose is:

```bash
sudo pip install docker-compose
```

OR, also you can check other official methods of installing Docker-Compose [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

**2. Run Userge**

We don't need to clone the repo (yeah Docker-Compose does that for us)

Setup configs (Download the sample config file)

```bash
mkdir userge && cd userge
```
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UsergeTeam/Loader/master/config.env.sample -O config.env
```
```
vim config.env
```
    
Download the yml file for Docker-Compose
    
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UsergeTeam/Loader/master/docker-compose.yml
```
Finally, start the bot

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
The bot should be running now. Check logs with

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

**Q. How to Stop the Bot?**

To stop the running bot in Docker, use this Stop Command

```bash
docker-compose stop
```

This will just stop the containers. Built images won't be removed. So next time you can start with this command

```
docker-compose start
```

It won't take time for building from scratch.
    
To delete the built image of Bot, use this Down command

```bash
docker-compose down
```
You can stop and delete the built images also. So next time you have to do this to start the bot.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

**Q. How to Update the Bot?**

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Changes will be fetched from git repo. You can change Repo URL from **docker-compose.yml** file.
