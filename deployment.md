# Deployment

This Userbot can be deployed with four different ways. Which are Heroku, Docker, Zeet and Legacy way.

[**Heroku**](https://theuserge.github.io/deployment.html#deploying-with-heroku) - A Free Platform providing developers to test or run their code. If you don't have VPS or dont want to deploy local on your system. This is the best place to deploy your Userbot for free.



[**Docker**](https://theuserge.github.io/deployment.html#deploying-with-docker-) - Run the Userbot in an isolated application that doesn't interfere to the system but uses your same system hardware and internet. You Just have to fill mandatory vars and 2-3 line commands to Run Userge on Docker.

[**Legacy-Method**](https://theuserge.github.io/deployment.html#deploying-with-legacy-method)- Using Python and all those packages which are required to Run this bot. You can also say a Manual way to deploy a userbot.

[**ZEET**](https://theuserge.github.io/deployment.html#deploying-on-zeet) - A free platform similar to Heroku. If you don't have VPS or dont want to deploy local on your system then You can deploy your userbot there. 


## Deploying with Heroku 


### **Steps to Deploy:**


**1.** [**Click here to deploy Userge.**](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/rking32/HelperScript) 


**2. Fill** [**Mandatory Vars**](https://theuserge.github.io/deployment.html#list-of-available-vars-in-userge) **values.**


**3. Click on Deploy Button.**


**4. Turn on Dyno from Resource Tab.** 


**5. That's it... Start using Userge.**


You can add [**Non-Mandatory Vars**](https://theuserge.github.io/deployment.html#non-mandatory-vars) later as per your needs. Those vars are used by their respective plugins in userbot to work. To know How to add Non-Mandatory vars, Check this [Guide](https://t.me/UnofficialPluginsHelp/31).

## Deploying with Docker üê≥

**1. Install Docker**

Follow the official Docker [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

You need to clone userge repository first by running:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/UsergeTeam/Userge.git
```
***Note:*** You can add -b flag to select branch which you want to be cloned

Example branch **master** cloning code:

```bash
git clone -b master https://github.com/UsergeTeam/Userge.git
```
Go to the working directory by running:
```bash
$ cd Userge
```
Open & set all the necessary config.env For example the config.env is in config.env.sample
```bash
$ mv config.env.sample config.env
```
Then edit config.env with your favorite text editor and save it!

Build docker image by running:

```bash
$ docker build . -t userge
```

Run container by:

```bash
$ docker run -d --restart on-failure --name userge_1 userge
```
Explanation of the command flags above :

1. `-d`: (_detach_) This will make your docker running even if you exit your console

2. `--restart on-failure`: Docker container will automatically restart if there is a failure on the running system

3. `--name userge_1`: Custom name for your container, instead of using the container id , this makes it easier for you to find it

To stop docker container run:

```bash
$ docker container stop userge_1
```
To get container logs:

```bash
$ docker logs userge_1 
```
## Run userge with docker-compose üêã
**1. Install Docker-Compose**

The easiest way to install docker-compose is:

```bash
$ sudo pip install docker-compose
```

OR also you can check other official methods of installing docker-compose [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

**2. Run Userge**

We don't need to clone the repo (yeah Docker-compose does that for us)

Setup configs (Download the sample config file)

```bash
$ mkdir userge && cd userge
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UsergeTeam/Userge/alpha/config.env.sample -O config.env
vim config.env
```
    
Download the yml file for docker-compose
    
```bash
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UsergeTeam/Userge/alpha/resources/docker-compose.yml
```
Finally, start the bot

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```
The bot should be running now. Check logs with

```bash
$ docker-compose logs -f
```

**Q. How to Stop the Bot?**

To stop the running bot in Docker use this Stop Command

```bash
$ docker-compose stop
```

This will just stop the containers. Built images won't be removed. So next time you can start with this command

```bash
$ docker-compose start
```

It won't take time for building from scratch.
    
To delete the built image of Bot. Use this Down command

```bash
$ docker-compose down
```
You can stop and delete the built images also. So next time you have to do this to start the bot.

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

**Q. How to Update the Bot?**

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Changes will be fetched from git repo. You can change repo url from **docker-compose.yml** file.

## Deploying with Legacy Method

### Requirements:

* Python 3.8 or higher version
* [Mandatory Vars](https://theuserge.github.io/deployment.html#mandatory-vars)

$ sudo apt install ./google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
```

**Notes:** Recommended FFMPEG version is 4.3 or above

**2. Clone the Repository**

```bash
